            <h3 class="sectionTitle">Overview</h3>
            <p>Yahoo! Inc. (Yahoo) is focused on making the world's daily habits inspiring and entertaining - whether you're searching the web, emailing friends, sharing photos with family, or simply checking the weather, sports scores or stock quotes. With research questions such as “What is required for a search engine to be trustworthy?” “What does a user need to see for each search result?” “How can the user experience design and branding of a search engine influence the trustworthiness?” in mind, three Information Science masters students from Cornell University - Trinh Le, Yeon Soo Park, and Jing Zhang - worked with UX Researcher Tejas Peesapati from Yahoo and advisor Professor Gilly Leshed for one semester as a part of INFO 5900 MPS Project course to research on user experience and the factors that influences the perceived trustworthiness of search results in order to design solutions that increase trustworthiness.

            <h3 class="sectionTitle">Activities</h3>
            <p>The project consisted of three phases: Research, User Studies, and Iterative Design & Evaluation.
            </p>
            <ol>
             <li> <p><strong>Phase 1 -- Research</strong> </p>
             <p>To obtain general idea of current behaviors of desktop search engine users for various search intents as well as factors that may impact the trustworthiness of search engine results, we conducted market research, literature review, and online discussion review.</p>

            <uL>
                <li><strong>Market Research:</strong>
                First, we used available online data analytics tools and reports to collect information about major desktop search engines (Yahoo, Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo, etc.), users, and their various search intents such as dining, sports, entertainment, and simple fact-checking.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Literature Review:</strong> Then, we reviewed 25 literatures (academic papers, magazine articles, etc.) to understand the relationship between search engine user experience and trustworthiness of results. We created a tabular document to summarize major findings for each source.</li>

                <li><strong>Online Discussion Review:</strong> We also reviewed existing online discussions on forums and social media to learn how people think about desktop search engines in general and the trustworthiness of results.
                </li>
            </uL>
             <p></p>
            </li>

            <li><p><strong>Phase 2 -- User Studies</strong></p> 
            <p>For this phase, we concentrated on learning about the user experience with desktop search engines and how it affects the perception of trustworthiness. Based on our findings from the research phase, we designed an online survey and observation & interview sessions.</p>
            <uL><li><strong>Online Survey:</strong>
                We created an online survey on Google Forms and with the help of the client uploaded it on Amazon Mechanical Turk to collect responses. The online survey consisted of five major sections: Internet Usage - General, Desktop Search Engine Usage - General, Desktop Search Engine Usage - 3 Most Recent Instances, Desktop Search Engine Trustworthiness, and Demographics.</li>
             <li><strong>Observation and Interview:</strong> 
                We also conducted user studies to learn about their search behaviors. There were three parts to the study procedure: observation, online questionnaire, and one-on-one interview.We asked participants to perform 6 tasks (2 fact-checking, 2 simple search, 2 complex search) on different search engines (randomly selected from Yahoo, Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo) and fill out a short online questionnaire after each task. 
                </li></uL><p></p>
            </li>

            <li><p><strong>Phase 3 -- Iterative Design and Evaluation</strong> </p>
            <p>After careful evaluation of results from the user studies, we determined current user needs, gaps and opportunities for search engines to increase trustworthiness. We then applied the findings to design recommendations and solutions for the problem. We had a total of three major design iterations, each followed by user testing for evaluation.</p>
                <uL><li><strong>Lo‐fi Prototype:</strong>
                We began by creating 2 different versions of lo-fi paper prototypes with our initial ideas. Talking to several users with these prototypes, we were able to highlight the key functionalities we should include in our design.</li>
                <li><strong>Mid‐fi Prototype:</strong> We created 8 interactive wireframes using Moqups, each with different design concepts we wanted to test with the users. We created an evaluation plan and conducted user testing according to that plan.</li>
                <li><strong>Hi‐fi Prototype:</strong>
                With the feedback we received from the users, we created an interactive hi-fi prototype using Axure, containing several variations of design details. And we ran another set of user testing with this prototype.</li>

                <li><strong>Final Design:</strong>
                After having received very positive feedback from the users, we made final updates to the design using Axure.
                </li>
                </uL><p></p>
            </li>

            <div id="designObjectives">
            <h3 class="sectionTitle">Outcomes</h3>
            <p><strong>Online Survey:</strong> We obtained 105 responses in total. With a fairly balanced sample of 48 males and 56 females, with age ranging from under 18 to 65 years and older with different levels of education, we found that the primary factors that people believed to affect the trustworthiness of desktop search engines are: Usefulness of information (83.8%), Accuracy of information (81%), Functionality of the site (65.7%), Information focus (49.5%), Information design/structure (41.9%), and Design look of the site (33.3%). Other findings related to internet usage complemented the results collected by Pew Research Center in 2012 such as people almost always found the information they were looking for (92.3%). More than 65% of the responses indicated that the information they found were mostly trustworthy and more than 70% said they were satisfied with it.</p>

                </figure>
            </div>
            <p><strong>Observation and Interview:</strong> We conducted 10 observation & interview sessions, with participants ranging from age fourteen to mid-forty. These studies revealed that the trustworthiness of search results was all about meeting user expectations. Users mentioned that having search results that are closely matched with the search terms are highly important. We also learned that the sources of the search results and their reputation are significantly important for users. Users considered sites that had well-known names (e.g. news sites) to be more authentic and reliable. They also expected to see more relevant, authentic results displayed at the top of the search results page with the date that the site was last updated. Many also favored direct display of the summary of search results on the search results page.</p>
            <p>On the contrary, users considered the search engine as untrustworthy if the results were displayed in a wrong order, the description given from the search engine sites lacked enough context of the content on the actual web pages or disconnected with the information displayed on the web pages. They also expressed dislike to advertisements, especially those that were totally irrelevant to their search terms. Outdated sites or getting indirect pages (pages that display the information related to the exact result but not the result itself) instead of the official sites were also concerned.</p>
            <p>Overall, we found that people prefer having the information displayed directly from the search pages instead of being redirected to different web pages. Users also pay attention to the sources and their reputation, relevancy to the search terms, and how updated they are. Thus, the design implications we learned from this process was to directly display answers on the search results page with clear visual snippet of the websites where the users are interested in being redirected, the date the web pages was last updated, and a clear visual cue of how useful each search result will be to help users set the right level of expectation.</p>
            </p>
            <p><strong>Final Design:</strong> We incorporated the feedback we received from user testing to create our final design:</p>
            <uL><li>Summary panel (on the right side of the search results page)</li>
            <li>Preview icon (document + magnifying glass icon) for each search result,
            showing on hover over</li>
            <li>Scrollable snippet window with highlighted keywords and anchored to
            the first highlighted keyword (on the right side of the search results page)
            for each search result, showing on preview icon click </li>
            <li>Last updated date for each search result</li>
            <li>5-star usefulness ranking for each search result</li>
            <li>Total number of results on top of the results page</li></uL>
