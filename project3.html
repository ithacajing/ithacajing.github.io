            <h3 class="sectionTitle">Overview</h3>
            <p>Yahoo! Inc. (Yahoo) is focused on making the world's daily habits inspiring and entertaining - whether you're searching the web, emailing friends, sharing photos with family, or simply checking the weather, sports scores or stock quotes. With research questions such as “What is required for a search engine to be trustworthy?” “What does a user need to see for each search result?” “How can the user experience design and branding of a search engine influence the trustworthiness?” in mind, three Information Science masters students from Cornell University - Trinh Le, Yeon Soo Park, and Jing Zhang - worked with UX Researcher Tejas Peesapati from Yahoo and advisor Professor Gilly Leshed for one semester as a part of INFO 5900 MPS Project course to research on user experience and the factors that influences the perceived trustworthiness of search results in order to design solutions that increase trustworthiness.

            <h3 class="sectionTitle">Activities</h3>
            <p>The project consisted of three phases: Research, User Studies, and Iterative Design & Evaluation.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <p><strong>Phase 1 -- Research</strong> To obtain general idea of current behaviors of desktop search engine users for various search intents as well as factors that may impact the trustworthiness of search engine results, we conducted market research, literature review, and online discussion review.</p>

            <li><strong>Market Research:</strong>
                First, we used available online data analytics tools and reports to collect information about major desktop search engines (Yahoo, Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo, etc.), users, and their various search intents such as dining, sports, entertainment, and simple fact-checking.
            </li>
                <li><strong>Literature Review:</strong> Then, we reviewed 25 literatures (academic papers, magazine articles, etc.) to understand the relationship between search engine user experience and trustworthiness of results. We created a tabular document to summarize major findings for each source.</li>

                <li><strong>Online Discussion Review:</strong> We also reviewed existing online discussions on forums and social media to learn how people think about desktop search engines in general and the trustworthiness of results.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <ol>
            <p><strong>Phase 2 -- User Studies</strong> For this phase, we concentrated on learning about the user experience with desktop search engines and how it affects the perception of trustworthiness. Based on our findings from the research phase, we designed an online survey and observation & interview sessions.</p>
            <li><strong>Online Survey:</strong>
                We created an online survey on Google Forms and with the help of the client uploaded it on Amazon Mechanical Turk to collect responses. The online survey consisted of five major sections: Internet Usage - General, Desktop Search Engine Usage - General, Desktop Search Engine Usage - 3 Most Recent Instances, Desktop Search Engine Trustworthiness, and Demographics.</li>
             <li><strong>Observation and Interview:</strong> We also conducted user studies to learn about their search behaviors. There were three parts to the study procedure: observation, online questionnaire, and one-on-one interview.We asked participants to perform 6 tasks (2 fact-checking, 2 simple search, 2 complex search) on different search engines (randomly selected from Yahoo, Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo) and fill out a short online questionnaire after each task. 
                </li>
                </ol>
                <ol>
            <p><strong>Phase 3 -- Iterative Design and Evaluation</strong> After careful evaluation of results from the user studies, we determined current user needs, gaps and opportunities for search engines to increase trustworthiness. We then applied the findings to design recommendations and solutions for the problem. We had a total of three major design iterations, each followed by user testing for evaluation.</p>
            <li><strong>Lo‐fi Prototype:</strong>
                We began by having Trinh create 2 different versions of lo-fi paper prototypes with our initial ideas. Talking to several users with these prototypes, we were able to highlight the key functionalities we should include in our design.</li>
             <li><strong>Mid‐fi Prototype:</strong> With the lead of Trinh, we then created 8 interactive wireframes using Moqups, each with different design concepts we wanted to test with the users. Jing took the role of creating an evaluation plan, and Jing and Yeon Soo conducted user testing according to that plan.</li>
            <li><strong>Hi‐fi Prototype:</strong>
                With the feedback we received from the users, Yeon Soo created an interactive hi-fi prototype using Axure, containing several variations of design details. Jing and Yeon Soo ran another set of user testing with this prototype.</li>

            <li><strong>Final Design:</strong>
                After having received very positive feedback from the users, Yeon Soo made final updates to the design using Axure.</li>
