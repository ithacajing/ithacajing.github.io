    <h2>Research</h2>
      <p>We conduct interdisciplinary research on the cell biology of phloem transport. Molecular, physiological, and anatomical techniques are employed in approximately equal measure. </p>
       
<p>Our primary interest is in phloem loading, the active accumulation of sugars in minor vein sieve elements and companion cells. Loading creates the pressure that drives long-distance flow and therefore motivates the whole-plant distribution of organic nutrients, signals and many protective compounds. One of our contributions to this area is the ‘polymer trap’ model that explains loading through the extremely fine pores, called plasmodesmata, that link plant cells (symplastic transport).</p>
     
<p>We have also found that the primary products of photosynthesis in certain plants (e.g. willow and apple) simply diffuse from mesophyll cells into the phloem through plasmodesmata. This may prove to be a common transport mechanism, since plants with symplastically connected minor vein phloem, almost all of which are trees, constitute approximately half of all dicotyledonous species.</p>
      
<p>Since much of our work revolves around plasmodesmata, we also conduct studies on the ultrastructure and function of these very fine, sophisticated pores. In collaboration with other labs, we study the systemic transport of the phloem-limited bacterium (Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus) that causes the citrus green disease (Huanglongbing) devastating orchards around the world.</p>
      
<p>In another project, we have recently found that the small protein that induces flowering in many species (FLOWERING LOCUS T; FT), is synthesized in a specific pair of phloem cells in the small leaf veins of both Arabidopsis thaliana and Nicotiana tabacum. When these cells are killed by genetic expression of the diphtheria toxin gene, the plants do not flower on time. Since the complex signaling pattern that initiates FT synthesis is not affected by this killing technique, it is clear that the regulatory proteins are made in other cells and that the interaction of the signals involves intercellular transport.</p>
     
<p>Our work is funded by grants from the National Science Foundation and the US Department of Agriculture.</p>
